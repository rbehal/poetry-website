# Poetry Flipbook [Website Link](http://dilse.life/)

## Motivation

My mom is really passionate about poetry and wanted a way to share her work. As a result, I made a simple flipbook using an open source Vue.JS component to display her poetry. There is also functionality on the backend allowing her to add/change the pages on the website. The backend is hosted on a lightweight AWS EC2 instance using Python with Flask for the PDF processeing.
